# ME GC EMA Project Colleen Caleshu

This is a custom em requested by colleen.  It is supposed to work by setting a 'start-date' and then calculating up to 27 different timestamps based on various criteria over 3 days.  

It then schedules survey invitations for each event that corresponds to a date/time.

If randomization = 1, then the day 3 events are not scheduled.

If you re-check the box, it will remove any queued invitations and replace them.

It requires that you have Twilio / SMS configured on this project and SMS is the default delivery mechanism.
